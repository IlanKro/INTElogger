# INTElogger

Yes, this is a keylogger, but it's made as a lesson on system security:
in the aspect of securing your data, how to send encrypted data online and how to not be fooled by malicous programs.
We don't intend for anyone to use this but we are keeping it public for learning purposes.

# Requirements:
Python 3.6+

# Installed via pip:
  Cryptography
  Pyinput
  
# How to use  
1. Download
2. install dependecies
3. run miner
4. type stuff
5. if any of your typing is from the following keyword list: ["bank", "hmo", "facebook", "mail", "paypal"] (found in the keylogger file)
6. Then the keys you input within the next SAVES_BUFFER_SIZE*KEYSTROKES_BUFFER_SIZE should be sent specified in the keylogger file.

# notes:
1. The miner saves random files named INTEcoin{coin number}.dat files those contain actually nothing important
2. The site is just a download link for the git directory.
3. The site is not convincing on purpose since we don't intend this to be anything close to real attack, but jsut a "this is possible if it was more convincing" scenario.
